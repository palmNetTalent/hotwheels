 <h3>In 2012, I attended the Obama inaugural</h3>
Went to the staff ball.<br> 
Gaga paid us a call.<br>
I'll prove it.<br>

<br>
MO had a bit too much to drink<br> 
So she didn't speak.<br>
Her husband said,<br>
"Michelle is being silly."<br>
<br>
Gaga was only going to play a few songs<br> 
With Mr. Bennett<br>
But the throngs wouldn't hear of it.<br>
We demanded more.<br>
<br>
  She grasped her billowing white gown<br>
  Froze as her mind wound<br>
  Searching for a sound.<br>
  Turned around and sat back down. <br>
  <br>
  Played anothger perfect score<br>
  As the crowd roared<br>
  For four more years. <br>
  How are hopes soared through tears. <br>
  <br>
  All of this is verifiable. <br>
  Undeniable.<br>
  <br>
  And admit it. <br>
  I'm a blast and you're having fun. <br>
  Call Mother Monster. <br>
  She'll confirm. <br>
